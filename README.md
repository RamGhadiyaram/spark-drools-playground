# spark-drools-playground

Just an attempt for learners to mentor Spark with Jboss drools(https://www.drools.org/). 

Problem : If you need to apply lot of rules based on udf its very complex to maintain since lot of 
if else but then and so on....


Solution : Drools came up with the solution drl file/decision table etc... where your logic will be written
business can provide the rules dynamically and if they are in class path 
Required : Scala /Drools 6/Spark 2.3.1

Works like a standalone program in intellij
